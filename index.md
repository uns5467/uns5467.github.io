### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorite of mine as it was the beginning and the platform for what would become a larger understanding of my time in my intro to programming course. This lab allowed me to gain an understanding and a step into how to navigate the repository, how to use the terminal, and understanding the C++ code. All together this lab gave me the ability to set a ground and platform to work from.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite lab of mine as it was a lab that I remembered had the most collaboration with my partner and had both of us working very hard towards finishing the instructions given. I had also enjoyed the topic of the lab which was inputting ingredients to a sandwich to create a full sentence. Both me and my partner took close and very patient time to type down the lines in accordance with the instructions.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 is my favorite lab out of the three as this lab was a group lab that consisted of 3 people including myself to problem solve and write out our code. Not only was the group factor a reason for favoriting this lab but it was also the topic. As this lab consisted of understanding street signs and translating the parking hours into understanding the days and hours, including the street name.
